# Work-Day-Scheduler-BootCamp5

<h3> Title: Work Day Scheduler</h3>
<h5><i>With User Input</i></h5>

<h3>Description:</h3> 
    This project usees JQuery and some basic Javascript to generate a simply hourly schedule to use for work-day organization (9am-6pm).   The project utilizes JQuery to create html elements and append that elements to the initial hourblock rows.  Moment.js is also utilized to enable accurate date and time rendering. The project also includes Bootstraped-enabled html file with basic styling.  
    
    The schedule dynamically changes in the following ways:

        1) The current date is reflected in the header (enabled by Moment.js)
        2) The color of each hourblock changes based on past time (grey), present hour (red), or future (green).  I utilized a JQuery "for each" function to make the colors change throughout the day.
        3) The user can input a reminder, appointment, or other note in the color-coded input field associated with that hour block (9AM, 10AM, 11AM, etc).  
        4) The user can click any save button to save their input. 
        5) The information is saved to local storage and retained when the user refreshes the site.
